# both options take values in the form of a newline-separated list, with each
# item formatted as:
#       change code, new file path, old file path
# where change codes are one of Git's native change codes. Currently supported
# change codes are:
#       R: Renamed file
#       M: Modified file
#       A: Added file (displayed as "new file" Git)
#       D: Deleted file
# Note that "added" and "deleted" files still need both a "new path" and an
# "old path" field, but they can be set to any arbitrary string, e.g.:
#       D, /deleted/file's/old/path.txt, FoO/bAr/YoU'rE/dElEtEd.goodbye
