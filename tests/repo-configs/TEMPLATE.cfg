# REPO fields
# untracked files:
#   - (newline-separated list) paths to untracked files (from the repository's
#     root directory)
# staged_changes/unstaged_changes
#   - both options take values in the form of a newline-separated list of
#     double-colon-separated 3-tuples, i.e.:
#       change type :: old file path :: new file path
#     where the change type is one of Git's native change codes.
#   - Currently supported change types are:
#       R: Renamed file
#       M: Modified file
#       A: Added file (displayed as "new file" Git)
#       D: Deleted file
#   - NOTE the information in the template values below

# Two final formatting notes:
#   - full-line comments are allowed anywhere, but inline comments are

#   - each submodule should have its own config file, also based on this
#     template, and placed in the `submdoule-configs` directory
